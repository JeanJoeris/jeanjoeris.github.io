  Last weekend I helped with Try Turing Fort Collins as a TA and on a panel of Turing students.
  Over two days, prospective students tried back-end and front-end engineering.
  As a Fort Collins native with an interest in teaching, I couldn't pass it up.
</p>

<p>
  I was there on the front-end day, which allowed me to teach and learn. I've only recently
  learned html and css, so helping others learn these skills was daunting.
  Once we got started, I was able to apply general programming and debugging skills to
  help students. This was rewarding, and gave me confidence in what I have been learning in Turing.
</p>

<p>
  As we moved into css animations and jQuery, I was into new territory. It was exciting to dive deeper
  into front-end. I was pleasantly surprised with how many of programming skills transferred.
  It was liberating to see the same skills being useful in creative and expressive ways.
  Applying these skills, I was able learn and teach at the same time. This drove home just how much
  I have learned these past 10 weeks.
</p>

<p>
  As a feminist, I was glad the attendees were asking real questions about
  sexism, racism, and privilege in tech. As a developer and student of Turing,
  I was able to say they are definitely problems, but there are also people creating change.
  It is awesome to be studying at a place that recognizes the importance of these issues.

  It was great to visit home, and the event taught me a huge amount. My only regret is not
  being there Saturday when they had delicious pizza from a place I used to work.
