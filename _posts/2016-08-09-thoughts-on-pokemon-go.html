  The launch of Pokemon Go has been a fun cultural moment to watch. A convergence of
  early AR technologies and 90s nostaliga has gotten bigger than anyone expected.
  Now that emotions have cooled somewhat, I wanted to share some thoughts on
  Pokemon Go's design. Specifically, I believe there is a lot to learn from how it
  adapted Pokemon to mobile. Despite many large design changes, a fundamental sense
  of <em>Pokemon</em> is maintained. That's easy to say, but what does it mean to be
  Pokemon? There are many ways to define it, but two obvious ones are defining it
  by gameplay and the setting.

  <p>Well, emotions have mostly cooled...</p>

<h3>Gameplay as Core Motivation</h3>
<p>
  I know 90s-playground-me cared a lot more about the game play. During the height
  of the first Pokemon craze, when they were banning it in schools, this was what
  Pokemon was about to me -
</p>

<ul>
  <li>You catch Pokemon and make them fight</li>
  <li>They level up by defeating other foes</li>
  <li>If they fight enough, they evolve</li>
  <li>Battle gym leaders to prove you strength and move through the game</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, dog-fighting with pocket monsters</p>

<p>
  All of these revolve around the battle system. As I grew up and played more JRPGs
  I learned that this battle system wasn't ground-breaking in any way. All the same,
  Pokemon was about HP, PP, TMs, HMs and stats to me. This was embodied in my attitude
  towards the rare candy trick: more rare candies == more levels == more winning == more fun.
  In this framework, everything serves the combat system. The towns are spread out to
  force the player to travel. The travel causes the player to encounter wild Pokemon,
  which are caught and fought. Inevitably the player encounters other trainers, seeking
  combat much as the player does. After these journeys, towns serve several purposes in pacing.
  They give the player a relief and quiet times, with the soothing medicine of a PokeCenter.
  At the same time, towns with gyms build tension towards a climactic fight. The whole
  structure of the game cascades from a combat system.
</p>

<h3>World of Pokemon as Core Motivation</h3>
<p>
  This is not the only valid interpretation of Pokemon. Instead of the perspective of a excited
  child, start with the perspective of the preeminent scholar of Pokemon, Professor Oak.
  At the beginning of every game, Oak (or a version of him) explains to the world of Pokemon
  to the player. Distilling this speech down we understand Pokemon is about -
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The world is inhabited by Pokemon</li>
  <li>Pokemon are used for</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Pets</li>
    <li>Fighting</li>
    <li>Studying</li>
  </ul>
  <li>A world of dreams and adventures with Pokemon awaits</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Without much change, the game becomes about adventuring in a world of Pokemon rather
  than fighting. Yes there is fighting, but it is not the defining feature of the game.
  Fighting isn't even the first use listed for Pokemon! Without changing anything about
  the game, an alternative motivation for playing the game emerges. The core motivation
  can become exploring a world with spectacular monsters like an electric rat or a squirrel
  turtle.
</p>

<h3>Where Does Pokemon Go Fit In?</h3>
<p>
  When Niantic set out to make a mobile Pokemon game, I'm sure they considered what
  parts of the original Pokemon experience would make the transition well. I believe
  the decisions they made are obvious in the final product. With a tapping-focused
  combat system used only in gym fights and trainer battles nowhere to be seen, clearly
  Niantic didn't want to drop the original combat system onto smart phones. While some
  corners of the internet are upset at this choice, it serves the game extremely well.
  In a mobile space, users will only be interacting with your app for small periods
  of time. Two trainers duking it out with six Pokemon just doesn't fit with the way
  most users will play. Those seeking that experience always have the core games.
</p>
<p>
  If Pokemon is defined by its combat gameplay, then Niantic is moving Pokemon Go
  away from the "true" Pokemon experience. Instead, Pokemon Go is about exploring
  a world filled with Pokemon, just like Professor Oak described in the original games.
  It looks different, but still feels like Pokemon.
</p>
<p>
  The space that was used for structuring combat and pacing in the orignal games
  now becomes important for its own sake. The space and the Pokemon it holds is
  what the game is about, <em>not</em> the combat that might take place in this space.
  Further, the emphasis on exploration of a real space creates an exercise game with
  little effort on the game devs part. Pokemon Go was not created as an exercise app,
  but creating a digital world people want to explore leads to a exercise app.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  When adapting a product between platforms/media, it is worth spending the time to
  understand what makes people engage it. There might be multiple answers, and too
  much focus on the obvious ones can be limiting. Instead, figure out what your product
  <em>can</em> mean, and pick the meaning right for the context.
