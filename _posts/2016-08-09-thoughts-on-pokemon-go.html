  The launch of Pokémon Go has been a fun cultural moment to watch. A convergence of
  early AR technologies and 90s nostaliga has gotten bigger than anyone expected.
  Now that emotions have cooled somewhat, I wanted to share some thoughts on
  Pokémon Go's design. Specifically, I believe there is a lot to learn from how it
  adapted Pokémon to mobile. Despite many large design changes, a fundamental sense
  of <em>Pokémon</em> is maintained. That's easy to say, but what does it mean to be
  Pokémon? There are many ways to define it, but two obvious ones are defining it
  by gameplay and the setting.

  <p>Well, emotions have mostly cooled...</p>

<h3>Gameplay as Core Motivation</h3>
<p>
  I know 90s-playground-me cared a lot more about the game play. During the height
  of the first Pokémon craze, when they were banning it in schools, this was what
  Pokémon was about to me -
</p>

<ul>
  <li>You catch Pokémon and make them fight</li>
  <li>They level up by defeating other foes</li>
  <li>If they fight enough, they evolve</li>
  <li>Battle gym leaders to prove you strength and move through the game</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, dog-fighting with pocket monsters</p>

<p>
  All of these revolve around the battle system. As I grew up and played more JRPGs
  I learned that this battle system wasn't ground-breaking in any way. All the same,
  Pokémon was about HP, PP, TMs, HMs and stats to me. In this framework, everything
  serves the combat system. The towns are spread out to force the player to travel.
  The travel causes the player to encounter wild Pokémon,
  which are caught and fought. Inevitably the player encounters other trainers, seeking
  combat much as the player does. After these journeys, towns serve several purposes in pacing.
  They give the player a relief and quiet times, with the soothing medicine of a PokeCenter.
  At the same time, towns with gyms build tension towards a climactic fight. The whole
  structure of the game cascades from a combat system.
</p>

<h3>World of Pokémon as Core Motivation</h3>
<p>
  This is not the only valid interpretation of Pokémon. Instead of the perspective of a excited
  child, start with the perspective of the preeminent scholar of Pokémon

</p>

<p>
  At the beginning of every game, Professor Oak (or a version of him) explains to the world of Pokémon
  to the player. His speech is the only exposition we get before being dropped into the world.
  Distilling it down the points he made -
</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are creatures called Pokémon</li>
  <li>Pokémon are used for</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Pets</li>
    <li>Fighting</li>
    <li>Studying</li>
  </ul>
  <li>A world of dreams and adventures with Pokémon awaits</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Without much change, the game becomes about adventuring in a world of Pokémon rather
  than fighting. Yes there is fighting, but it is there to create adventures and experiences.
  Fighting isn't even the first use listed for Pokémon! Without changing anything about
  the game, an alternative motivation for playing the game emerges. The core motivation
  can become exploring a world. Dreams and adventures with electric rats and squirrel
  turtles await.
</p>

<h3>Where Does Pokémon Go Fit In?</h3>
<p>
  When Niantic set out to make a mobile Pokémon game, I'm sure they considered what
  parts of the original Pokémon experience would make the transition well. I believe
  the decisions they made are obvious in the final product. With a tapping-focused
  combat system used only in gym fights and trainer battles nowhere to be seen, clearly
  Niantic didn't want to drop the original combat system onto smart phones. While some
  corners of the internet are upset at this choice, it serves the game extremely well.
  In a mobile space, users will only be interacting with your app for small periods
  of time. Two trainers duking it out with six Pokémon just doesn't fit with the way
  most users will play. Those seeking that experience always have the core games.
</p>

<p>
  If Pokémon is defined by its combat gameplay, then Niantic is moving Pokémon Go
  away from the "true" Pokémon experience. Instead, Pokémon Go is about exploring
  a world filled with Pokémon, just like Professor Oak described in the original games.
  It looks different, but still feels like Pokémon.
</p>

<p>
  The space that was used for structuring combat and pacing in the original games
  now becomes important for its own sake. The space and the Pokémon it holds is
  what the game is about, <em>not</em> the combat that might take place in this space.
  Further, the emphasis on exploration of a real space creates an exercise game with
  little effort on the game dev's part. Pokémon Go was not created as an exercise app,
  but creating a digital world people want to explore leads to a exercise app.
</p>

<p>
  Pokémon Go isn't without flaws. I'd definitely be happy if they add trainer
  battles and I miss the old tracking system. However, Niantic kept their game
  to a minimum viable product that was true to the brand. This will hopefully
  give them a solid platform to fulfill more Pokemon dreams.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  When adapting a product between platforms/media, it is worth spending the time to
  understand what makes people engage it. There might be multiple answers, and too
  much focus on the obvious ones can be limiting. Instead, figure out what your product
  <em>can</em> mean, and pick the meaning right for the context.
