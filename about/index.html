<h2 style="text-align: center">About me</h2>

<p>
  I am Jean Joeris. I live in Arvada, CO with my wife, a cat and a dog. I attended
  CU, Boulder and studied physics and math. With this as a starting point, I am taking
  my math and programming skills and applying them to web development. I am further
  growing these skills by attending <a href="https://turing.io">Turing School of Software and Design</a>
  I love to tinker with code, and in addition to web development I enjoy making games.
  I am also teaching myself about machine learning and neural nets.

<p>
  This blog is intended as a place for sharing my successes, exploring computer
  science, and discussing game design. While it may veer into other territory,
  this is the intended scope.
